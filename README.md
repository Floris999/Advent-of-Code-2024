# Advent of Code 2024

Welcome to my Advent of Code 2024 repository! This year, I'm diving into the challenges with my favorite language, PHP. While I don't expect to complete all the challenges, I'm excited to tackle a few and see how far I can get.

## Why PHP?

I'm absolutely in love with PHP, and it's my go-to language for solving problems. It's versatile, powerful, and perfect for the kind of challenges presented in Advent of Code.

## My Approach

This year, I'm taking a slightly different approach. Instead of constantly looking up functions and solutions on sites like Stack Overflow, I'm leveraging AI to assist me. It's an experiment to see how effective AI can be in helping me solve these challenges. Note that I dont let AI solving the puzzles for me! But what is the difference between looking up snippes of code on Google, or using AI?

## Disclaimer

I don't expect to complete all the challenges, but I'm here to have fun and learn along the way. Whether I finish a few or many, the journey is what matters most.
